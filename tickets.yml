  - title: Add tests for existing functionality
    description: |
      There is some functionality that already exists, and once you have
      established a connection to your cloud Mongo database, you will be able to
      use this functionality. However, there are no tests!

      Your task is to add tests for the current existing functionality.

  - title: Implement GET functionality for the different TrackRepository methods
    description: |
      As part of the TrackRepository file, you will see some methods that should
      perform some find tasks against the MongoDB database. 
      
      Your task will be to implement these features so that your API can handle
      these upcoming request from clients.

  - title: Implement PUT for tracks
  description: |
    A user complained that they made a typo once they added a new track and now
    they can't seem to update this information.

    We would like to be able to update both the track name and author. Or either
    of these two as needed by the user.
    
    Your task will be to add this functionality.

  - title: Implement DELETING tracks
    description: |
      Based on a DELETE request from the client, a relevant track should be
      erased from the database.
